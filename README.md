# Vending Machine Kata using .NETCore

This an rendition of the Vending Machine Kata where I attempted to use Visual Studio for Mac to build the solution. 

It is an non-working solution .

I took a different approach to building this solution from the Java solution in trying to build up the stub methods that would make the presumed functions work. This made me consider rework of the Java solution to use this path instead of from the entity models. 

Thank you, Tony
